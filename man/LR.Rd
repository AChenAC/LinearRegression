\title{Linear Regression}
\usage{
LR(formula, data, include.intercept = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{An object of class "formula": a symbolic description of the model to be fitted. A typical model has the form outcome ~ covariates
where outcome is the numeric response vector (which people usually denote as Y in statistical formula) and covariates are predictor of response.}

\item{data}{A data frame (or object coercible by as.data.frame to a data frame) containing the variables in the model.}

\item{include.intercept}{If the model should fit with intercept, include.intercept = TRUE; if model should fit without intercept,
then include.intercept = FALSE. The default setting for include.intercept is TRUE.}
}
\value{
LR does not explicitly return anything unless extract the value with $ followed with the name of desired output.
The returned output is a list containing at least the following components:
\describe{
  \item{coefficients}{a named vector of coefficients}
  \item{residuals}{the residuals (i.e. response minus fitted values)}
  \item{fitted.values}{the predicted value}
  \item{sigma}{the residual standard error}
  \item{df}{degrees of freedom}
  \item{coeff_summary}{mimic the result from using summary(lm()) which includes estimates of beta coefficients, standard error, t value, and p-value}
  \item{R_squared}{the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by independent variable(s)}
  \item{adj_R_squared}{a penalized version of R_squared}
  \item{CI}{95\% confidence interval of estimates (i.e. coefficients)}
  \item{fstatistic}{Give the overall F statistic and its corresponding degrees of freedom}
  \item{p_value_F_test}{p-value for overall F test}
}
}
\description{
LR is used to fit linear model. It yields the same results as lm( ), summary(lm( )), and confint( ) functions.

\examples{

LR(mpg ~ cyl + wt, mtcars)$coefficients ## Obtain beta coefficient estimates
LR(mpg ~ cyl + wt + disp, mtcars)$coeff_summary ## Obtain summary of beta coefficients
LR(mpg ~ cyl + wt, mtcars)$sigma ## Obtain residual standard error
LR(mpg ~ cyl + wt + qsec, mtcars)$CI ## Obtain 95\% confidence interval
LR(mpg ~ cyl + wt, mtcars, include.intercept = FALSE) ## omitting intercept
LR(mpg ~ cyl + wt + qsec + disp, mtcars, include.intercept = FALSE)$df ## Extract degrees of freedom when fitting a model without an intercept
